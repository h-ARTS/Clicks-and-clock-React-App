# Clicks and Clock - React App

My very first React App.

It has a Clock and you can count clicks by pressing the button.

### How to use

1. Just clone the repo
2. Open the Terminal and change to this directory
3. Enter:
```
node server.js
``` 
4. Open localhost:8080 in browser
5. Done!

Not more not less.
